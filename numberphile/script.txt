JAMES GRIME: We love pi, of course.
0:01
Everyone loves pi.
0:02
But one of my favorite pi facts is--
0:05
and I think it's fun.
0:07
You only need 39 digits of pi to be able to measure the
0:13
circumference of the observable universe within the
0:17
width of one hydrogen atom.
0:21
And that's all you need.
0:23
Shall we write out the 39 digits?
0:27
So the 39 digits of pi.
0:29
It's 3 point--
0:31
now, 3 counts as one of the digits.
0:33
So it's now 38 decimal places.
0:35
Let's do the 38 decimal places--
0:37
1 4 1 6 5 9 7 9 3 2 7 4 2 0.
0:48
-He didn't memorize that, everyone.
0:50
There you go.
0:51
Show them what you did, just in case.
0:53
JAMES GRIME: Wolfram Alpha app, never leave
0:55
home without it.
0:57
-You're not a pi memorizer, James.
0:59
JAMES GRIME: No, I'm not.
1:01
And that's another thing altogether, people that
1:03
memorize this pi figure to a massive amount of digits.
1:08
But people who calculate it using computers, have
1:11
calculated it to, currently, 10 trillion digits of pi.
1:17
-Go on then.
1:18
Let's do it.
1:18
JAMES GRIME: OK.
1:20
So that would be all you need.
1:22
And that's overkill as it is.
1:23
Because that's all you need to measure the circumference of
1:27
the observable universe.
1:28
So the observable universe is the distance that light has
1:32
traveled since the big bang.
1:34
And if you say travelled in a big sphere, in a big bubble,
1:37
then if you measured the distance around it, we'd have
1:40
the circumference of the universe.
1:42
And we would need pi to work out that circumference.
1:45
And we could be as accurate as a hydrogen atom, if we used
1:50
just 39 digits of pi.
1:53
We don't need to use the whole thing, of course, which goes
1:56
on forever.
1:58
So in fact, and in practical day-to-day use in engineering
2:01
and real life, you would only need a handful of digits of pi
2:06
to have an accuracy that would be suitable for anything that
2:10
you need to do.
2:11
So Wolfram Alpha told me that the diameter of the universe
2:15
was 8.8 times 10 to the 26 meters.
2:22
So that's the diameter of the observable universe.
2:25
If you want to work out the circumference, then
2:27
we times it by pi.
2:28
So the circumference would be pi times the diameter.
2:32
What's the difference when I take away my truncated pi?
2:37
What I mean is, what if I took away my pi with 39 digits--
2:42
I've called it pi 39--
2:44
and did the same thing times my d?
2:47
So that's the real circumference of the universe,
2:49
take away my approximation.
2:51
What's the difference?
2:52
If I do that, what I got was actually around about 2.5
2:59
times 10 to the minus 12 meters.
3:04
So that's how accurate.
3:06
That's the difference between my approximation
3:09
and the real value.
3:10
That's how accurate it is.
3:12
And a hydrogen atom that Wolfram Alpha told me had a
3:15
diameter of about 2.5 times 10 to minus 11 meters.
3:23
So in fact, this is more accurate.
3:25
This is more accurate than a hydrogen atom.
3:28
So why do we calculate pi to 10 trillion digits?
3:31
These days, it's a way to test our computers, our
3:34
supercomputers and our algorithms.
3:37
It's a way to test them to see how good they are.
3:40
That's why computer scientists are interested in
3:42
this sort of thing.
3:43
Mathematicians have tried to do this for thousands of years
3:49
out of curiosity.
3:51
So it started with Archimedes.
3:53
He tried to get an accurate idea of pi about 250 BC.
4:00
He didn't have decimals in those days.
4:01
He had to use fractions.
4:02
But he tried to work it out.
4:04
Then in the 17th century, there was a Dutch
4:07
mathematician called-- now I'll probably Anglicize his
4:10
Dutch name.
4:11
And I apologize.
4:12
He was called Ludolph van Ceulen.
4:15
And his life's work was working out the digits of pi.
4:20
And by the end of his life, he had worked out
4:23
35 digits of pi.
4:25
And they're on his tombstone, which is kind of cool.
4:28
It's kind of neat.
4:29
We skip on to the 19th century.
4:31
There was a guy who had about 707 digits of pi.
4:35
This was the authoritative example of pi for over 100
4:38
years, until 1945.
4:42
And they found a mistake.
4:44
I know, shock.
4:45
They found a mistake.
4:47
And the last 180 digits were wrong.
4:50
Because somewhere along in his calculations, somewhere around
4:54
the 500th decimal point, he had made a mistake.
4:58
And from that point on, everything else was wrong.
5:01
What a disaster.
5:02
Fortunately, we were able to use computers by this point.
5:06
So in 1949, ENIAC, the American computer, was able to
5:10
calculate pi to 2000 digits.
5:14
So suddenly, it just exploded after that.
5:16
Once we've got computers, it just exploded.
5:19
We had more and more digits of pi.
5:21
And now, we've got 10 trillion digits of pi.
